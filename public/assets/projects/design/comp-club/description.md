# Background

Back in National University of Singapore, I served as the IT Director and subsequently
President of the Students' Computing Club. The club's objective is to provide for
the welfare of the student population. During this time, I completed many design
projects ranging from web design to publicity materials.

# Website Design

The club's website has traditionally been scattered over various services (mostly
Blogger). To retain the club's history, an effort to consolidate all old blogs
owned by the club was made. All old posts were successfully migrated to the new
platform based on WordPress.

The website also presents an opportunity to consolidate all existing services
provided by the Club to a single portal. To ensure easy access, a domain was
acquired and existing services were each assigned a subdomain. The sitemap of
the website provides one-click access to all services provided by the Club.

## Technologies

The website takes extensive advantage of CSS3 features for greater visual appeal.
It integrates with Facebook API for social integration.

The backend code is based on WordPress, which is written in PHP. The frontend is
written in HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Access

An archived copy of the website can be accessed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120402221021/http://nuscomputing.com/).

# Collateral Design

I refreshed the logo, letterhead and PowerPoint templates for the club.
