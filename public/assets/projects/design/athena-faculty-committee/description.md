# Background

During my time at Hwa Chong Institution, I served as the Publicity In-Charge for
a faculty club called Athena. The club holds many events for the student body.

In the pictures below, you will find designs for a faculty event *Green Light District*
and a faculty drama production *Green Line*. There are also designs for the
school magazine, *MOCH: Hwa Chong's Own Magazine* and additional orientation
materials.
