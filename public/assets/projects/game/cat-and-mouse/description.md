# About The Game

This game is a 4-player game. One person takes the role of the cat, and the 3 others
take the role of the mice. The goal of the mice is to eat as many cheese as possible
without being caught by the cat. The goal of the cat is to eat as many mice as possible.

# Challenges

As this is an asymmetric game, one of the main challenges of this game was to keep
it balanced. We were able to achieve a decent game balance by healthy amounts of
playtesting.
