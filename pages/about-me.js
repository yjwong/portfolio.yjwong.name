          Hi! I'm Yong Jie. I am a Malaysian and I'm 24 this year. I'm a graduate
          student from <a href="http://cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>&nbsp;
          <a href="http://etc.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Entertainment Technology Center (ETC)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am enthusiastic about everything related to technology and design,
          and that includes stuff like gadgets, computer architecture and mobile
          phones. In the outdoors, I love cycling, scaling waterfalls and playing
          badminton.
        </p>

        <h3>Academia</h3>

        <p>
          I previously studied in Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore for 6 years
          under the ASEAN Scholarship and ASEAN Pre-University Scholarship. At
          Junior College, I offered H2 Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (something like Philosophy,
          but more of Epistemology), H2 Physics, H2 Mathematics and H2 Chemistry.

          in leadership skills and people management.

          I love playing badminton, bowling, volleyball, cycling and many other
          sports. In 2009, I participated in the intra-school SMASH badminton
          competition aimed at non-competitive badminton players. I ended up
          4th in the competition.
